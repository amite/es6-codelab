# ES6 Codelab

## Master the fundamentals of Modern Javascript

Don't let terms like “de-structuring” and tricky looking arrow functions scare you away. Es6 is easier and friendlier than you think! And you don’t need to know all of it.

In 2.5 hours we will be covering 10 essential and practical topics which you need to know to start building a deeper foundation for writing universal modern JavaScript.

## Reference

This slidedeck was built using  Spectacle[https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown).

## Development

After downloading the boilerplate, your first order of business is to open terminal and run `yarn`. (or `npm install` if you're about that life)

Next, run `rm -R .git` to remove the existing version control.

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll

## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`
